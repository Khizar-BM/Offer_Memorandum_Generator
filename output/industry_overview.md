The segment for multitools, which falls under the hardware tools market, is also witnessing steady growth. The global market for multitools is projected to expand at a CAGR of 4.7%, as consumers increasingly seek versatile and compact tools that cater to everyday needs. This trend is supported by the rising popularity of products that combine functionality with portability, appealing to consumers who value practicality in their purchases.

Key trends shaping the consumer goods industry include the integration of digital marketing strategies, the rise of e-commerce platforms like Amazon, and the use of affiliate marketing channels.
