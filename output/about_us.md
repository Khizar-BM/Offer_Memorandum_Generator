# About Us

At Star Spangled Flags, our mission is to celebrate and honor the spirit of patriotism with every flag we craft. Established in 2014 by Peter Swanson, our company has grown into a trusted name in premium flags, proudly offering a diverse collection that includes American, state, military, and historical flags, all 100% made in the USA. We take pride in our commitment to quality, evident in our use of durable nylon and polyester fabrics treated to resist UV degradation, ensuring each flag stands the test of time. With a focus on craftsmanship, we employ local artisans to create flags that symbolize the enduring values of our nation. Our primary sales channel is Amazon, where we handle 97% of our warehousing and shipping through Fulfillment By Amazon, but we also welcome customers to explore our offerings directly on our website.

Serving customers across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, Star Spangled Flags caters to those who value patriotism and the assurance of Made in USA products.

We continue to innovate and explore new opportunities, including expanding our product offerings and marketing strategies.
