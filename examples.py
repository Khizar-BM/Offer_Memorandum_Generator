company_overview_example = """

Website Closers® presents a Digital Marketing Agency that has firmly established
itself among US and EU clients over the course of 7 years. They are a full-service
agency, providing staple marketing services such as SMS marketing, UGC for ads,
and are in the process of exploring other high-demand services such as SaaS/B2B
marketing, paid Meta/Google ads, and recruitment as a service as “mini” add-on
services.
Their specialty, however, is their email marketing service, which accounts for 65% of
their revenue. Though they have a one-off option, their recurring model is the most
popular option and generates $160k monthly. The company generates an average of
$250k per month in total, with over 90% of these profits stemming from their
recurring services.
The agency currently has 40 active clients, with a 90% MRR and exceedingly low sub
5% churn rate. Their average client stays on for over a year and has an LTV of around
40k+. The company’s consumer base spans a wide range of industries, such as
supplements, apparel, luxury services, and furniture.
They further distinguish themselves through a low account manager/project manager
to client ratio. While similar agencies might have up to 10 to 12 accounts to person,
they typically have a maximum of 2 to 4, improving client satisfaction while reducing
their churn rate.
These qualities have made them one of only 34 Klaviyo Elite partners worldwide, a
HubSpot partner, and one of 11 agencies on Yotpo’s Email Advisory Board. They
also enjoyed a surge of massive social proof through a presentation at Affiliate World
Bangkok, bolstering their reputation.
Business Broker Takeaways
1. Optimized Hiring. The company's HR department can quickly hire talent
anywhere in the world at a third or less of the US prices, giving them access to
efficient and affordable labor.
This strategy allows them to deliver matching service at a third of the US price
while still maintaining 70% gross profit, giving them an edge over their many
competitors in the industry. This edge gives them steady profit margins ranging
from 20 to 30%.
2. Low Workload. Current ownership spends a mere 5 hours per week average on
their responsibilities. This workload primarily consists of them taking part in a
once a week call with directors where they add support if necessary.
A buyer could use their light workload to their advantage and focus on scaling,
and, if they wish to further reduce their hours, they could pass their duties onto
an experienced COO or even an owner operator.
3. High Ranking. The company has recently started advertising on Google and
targets their 8,300 subscribers through an email marketing campaign. Their
SEO plan, which consists of paid and organic links, keyword research, and
other careful strategies, has also proven fruitful, leading to a top organic
ranking for “best email marketing agency” and other similar terms.

The scaling potential for this B2B marketing agency lies in both their proven operational
foundation and the opportunities presented by emerging market demands. A new buyer will find
a business that has built their success on recurring revenue from long-term client relationships
and a robust reputation for delivering tangible results. This foundation offers multiple avenues
for scaling, particularly by leveraging the agency’s established frameworks and exploring
underutilized strategies.
The seller has relied on a disciplined 90-day execution cycle and consistent referrals to grow the
business organically. While effective, this leaves ample room for a new owner to implement a
more aggressive client acquisition strategy. A buyer could adopt a stronger digital marketing focus
to target mid-market CEOs and Fortune 1000 companies—the agency’s ideal client
demographic—through LinkedIn campaigns, search engine optimization, and a robust content
marketing strategy. The company can get more people to listen by doing webinar series or sharing
their podcasts more. This will help them be seen as a smart leader in their field.
With a projected $4M in revenue for 2025, the agency is already on a trajectory of growth, but a
buyer could capitalize on its scalable Fractional CMO + Senior Team model to accelerate this
further. Additionally, the operational efficiency of this business—supported by their skilled team
and advanced tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, and Google Analytics—means that scaling won’t
require a significant increase in overhead. A buyer can use these systems to streamline workflows
and focus on scaling services to existing clients while bringing in new ones. By enhancing their
cross-selling strategies and upselling additional services, the business could increase their
monthly retainers and boost revenue.
The foundation built by the seller ensures that the business is well-positioned for long-term
success. A buyer with a proactive marketing approach focused on expanding the Fractional CMO
model and strategic investments in digital outreach will find immense potential to scale this
business into an even more dominant player in the B2B marketing space. This is an opportunity
to take a proven, high-margin agency and unlock its full growth potential.

Scaling Opportunities:
➢ Expand service offerings to include influencer marketing, advanced analytics, and AI-
driven campaign tools.
➢ Target untapped industries or geographic regions to attract new clients.
➢ Leverage the Fractional CMO model to differentiate the company further and win
additional high-value accounts.

The B2B marketing industry is experiencing unprecedented growth as companies increasingly seek external expertise to enhance their marketing strategies, improve customer acquisition, and stay competitive in rapidly evolving markets. Over the past decade, marketing outsourcing has become a critical solution for businesses, particularly in the mid-market and enterprise segments, as they look to balance cost efficiency with high-impact results.
The global digital marketing industry, valued at $321 billion in 2022, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.1%, reaching $671 billion by 2030. This growth is fueled by advancements in technology, the rising importance of data-driven decision-making, and the increasing demand for specialized services such as search engine optimization (SEO), content marketing, and marketing automation. Businesses are focusing on integrating omnichannel strategies, blending traditional and digital approaches, and leveraging tools that deliver measurable ROI.
One of the most significant trends in the industry is the shift toward account-based marketing (ABM) and inbound strategies, which prioritize personalized outreach and nurture potential clients throughout the buyer’s journey. According to industry reports, businesses that adopt ABM see a 97% higher ROI compared to other marketing strategies. This has driven demand for agencies capable of executing complex, tailored campaigns, positioning them as essential partners for companies seeking to scale effectively.
Another driving force is the increasing reliance on marketing automation. The global marketing automation market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 12.3%, reaching $11.8 billion by 2027. This reflects a growing recognition among businesses of the need to streamline operations and use data analytics to drive targeted campaigns. Agencies offering expertise in this area are poised to benefit significantly as clients continue to invest in technologies that maximize efficiency and results.
With 83% of B2B companies planning to increase their digital marketing budgets over the next three years, the industry is set for sustained growth. For businesses like the one presented here, which combines a proven track record of delivering results with innovative models like the Fractional CMO + Senior Team service, the opportunity for growth is immense.
